## Project Motivation:
For 10 straight years, Seattle has been seeing a record number of tourists. In 2019, the number of people visiting Seattle rose to 41.9 million [1]. This influx has lead to the proliferation of rental properties in the city. Airbnb rentals have become a popular form of accommodation, and finding them is the city is not difficult.

This project aims to explore the available data from Kaggle on Seattle Airbnb data. The main topics will include determining price distributions, and ratings distribution across Seattle, Washington. A linear regression model will be used to predict the price, and rating of Seattle Airbnb rentals. This project forms part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.  

## Installations:
For this data science project, the following libraries are required:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Yellowbrick
- Folium

Use pip install to load the installations.

## File Descriptions
The Seattle_AirBNB_Data file is the main file to be viewed. The seattle.zip file contains all the available data on Seattle Airbnbs from 2017.

## How To Interact With the Project
The main report, Seattle_AirBNB_Data.ipynb, is a Jupyter notebook. All code and outputs can be viewed by opening the file on Github. If, however, there are any issues viewing the file, it may be due to Github being unable to render the file. If this occurs, visit https://nbviewer.org/github/Danieldacruz7/Exploring-Seattle-Airbnb-Data/blob/main/Seattle_AirBNB_Data.ipynb. Here you will be able to view the file without issues.
